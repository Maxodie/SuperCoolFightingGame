===== GAME RULES =====

Super Cool Fighting Game is, well, a fighting game. You can select a Character among the many available and face off against the computer,
which will randomly select its Character. Each turn, you are granted the choice to Attack, Defend or use your Special ability. 
After you've made your decision, the computer will make its, and the actions will then be executed. Be careful to wisely choose your
actions, as they have a specific priority order in which they are executed. With that said, once a Character's HP reaches 0, they are 
considered dead, and the last player to die wins the round! You're free to play as many rounds as you wish and experiment with the range
of Characters available, as the game automatically restarts once a round ends.
